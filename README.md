# Keto diet website

## Introduction
For my first project I have decided to make a keto diet hub, explaining the physical and medical benefits of the keto diet.
It will include and introduction and basic explanation, an information hub where there are questions and answers, lists of food and the carbs and net cards in specified portions, recipes split into categories, a form to sign up for email updates and downloadable pdfs.

The project consists of 5 pages using html and css.

## page layout, colour and site design
